            <p class="hangingindent">Pass by it all, faster till slow</p>
            <p class="hangingindent">Touch it with your hands</p>
            <p class="hangingindent">Unite, unite, destroy, disband</p>
            <p class="hangingindent">Hey, hey, slip on down to the part you hate</p>
            <br>
            <p class="hangingindent">Shattering all the glass, letting it fall to the ground</p>
            <p class="hangingindent">A bunny rabbit was the saint walking into your house</p>
            <p class="hangingindent">Bouncing past the wreckage of your home and soul</p>
            <p class="hangingindent">The bunny Saint came that day, and it took you away</p>
            <p class="hangingindent">Now, now you can play another day</p>
            <br>
            <p class="hangingindent">And I’m still traversing the home</p>
            <p class="hangingindent">Looking for my own personal Saint</p>
            <p class="hangingindent">Oh, hey! Save me</p>
            <p class="hangingindent">Oh, hey! Leave me.</p>
            <p class="hangingindent">Leave it all to the dog on the floor by the bog</p>
            <p class="hangingindent">Leave it all to the child shooting up and falling into the edge</p>
            <p class="hangingindent">Oh, hey!</p>
            <br>
            <p class="hangingindent">Conjoined into a dance move</p>
            <p class="hangingindent">Amorphous body super suit</p>
            <p class="hangingindent">I am me, I am the things of nonsense</p>
            <p class="hangingindent">Dressed up in ideas and fantasies</p>
            <p class="hangingindent">Dressed up in all my sugar, I’m ready for the mouth</p>
            <p class="hangingindent">Ready for the mouth that will eat me</p>
            <p class="hangingindent">The destiny that the dog in the bog has for me</p>
            <p class="hangingindent">The gift the kid shooting up on the block will give me</p>
            <p class="hangingindent">I must find my personal Saint</p>
            <br>
            <p class="hangingindent">You got yours first</p>
            <p class="hangingindent">Awakened in the afterglow of a hazy nightmare</p>
            <p class="hangingindent">“The fish will fly and the kids will die”</p>
            <p class="hangingindent">Were the words you said before you found a savior</p>
            <p class="hangingindent">And you held my hand, leaving me suddenly</p>
            <p class="hangingindent">As the bunny hopped over the dog</p>
            <p class="hangingindent">Bunny Saint! Bunny Saint!</p>
            <p class="hangingindent">It had came to take you away</p>
            <br>
            <p class="hangingindent">Left me in the bog with the dog</p>
            <p class="hangingindent">The kid shooting up on the sidewalk</p>
            <p class="hangingindent">Wandering the halls of my open mind</p>
            <p class="hangingindent">As the colors swarm me and the enemies wear disguise</p>
            <p class="hangingindent">I am lost in the sea of sound</p>
            <p class="hangingindent">There was someone else</p>
            <p class="hangingindent">Sanity or sanitation, or Satan</p>
            <p class="hangingindent">Their hand on my back</p>
            <p class="hangingindent">Pushing me off the ground</p>
            <p class="hangingindent">“Oh, hey!” I yelled</p>
            <p class="hangingindent">Hey, hey, fuck</p>
            <br>
            <p class="hangingindent">Her name:</p>
            <p class="hangingindent">Her name:</p>
            <p class="hangingindent">She had a name, attached to the churning wall</p>
            <p class="hangingindent">She was here once, gone away now</p>
            <p class="hangingindent">Pushed me forward with earnesty</p>
            <p class="hangingindent">Before I was falling. Now, flung into the sky</p>
            <p class="hangingindent">Personal saint, personal saint</p>
            <p class="hangingindent">Her Bunny Saint took her away</p>
            <p class="hangingindent">I want my personal saint</p>
            <p class="hangingindent">Save me from the fall.</p>

            Samuel Plauche is a writer of fiction and poetry. His writings explore the emotions and actions brought forth by love, grief, and trauma. Plauche has been influenced by his love for dream fiction as well as his Cajun heritage, and this manifests in his writing as he combines the themes of Cajun Gothic with abstract storytelling.

            Born on an island off the coast of Seattle, Washington, Plauche’s childhood was spent running around pine forests and exploring ponds. This is where his love for storytelling began to bloom, as he created tale after tale about what may lurk in the wood. During this time, Plauche began to take road trips with his family which blossomed another love of his; travel. Now, Plauche continually criss-crosses the United States of America, writing poetry and fiction about the people he meets and places he visits.

Plauche now lives in Logan Square, Chicago where he continues to write and plan for the next adventure.
