            <p>
            Welcome to fabulous Las Vegas. The golden sign shimmers brightly in the desert as the sun gleams against it, and I’m blinded when the cab drives past. Amy takes pictures out the window as we drive along The Strip, and she chats happily but I have my phone pressed against my ear.
            </p>
            <br>
            <p>
            It’s been an entire day since he’s said anything to me. When I texted good morning, he didn’t answer. When I told him I was boarding the plane, no answer. Four hours pass during the flight, and even after getting out of the airport, he still hasn’t responded. I’m playing with the Leo necklace around my neck, what Amy had given to me as an early birthday present before leaving Chicago. She says it’s to remind me that I’m a bad bitch, “as if your ego wasn’t already big enough,” but as the dial tone rings and rings, I don’t really feel like one. I’m wondering if it’s the poor connection from the desert, or the lag from recently switching off airplane mode, but there’s another thought that’s been eating me away since the start of summer.
        </p>
        <br>
        <p>
            “Hello?” His voice finally answers.
        </p>
        <br>
        <p>
            “I landed,” I immediately say. “Where are you?”
        </p>
        <br>
        <p>
            “LA…” He says it like it’s obvious.
        </p>
        <br>
        <p>           
            My stomach drops. “I thought you said you were coming to meet me?”
        </p>
        <br>
        <p>            
            There’s a small pause, before he quietly admits, “I’m kinda low on money right now…”
        </p>
        <br>
        <p>
            “Erik, we’ve been planning this <em>for a month</em>,” I state. I sit up sharply in my seat, which causes Amy to glance back at me from the window. “That was the whole point of me coming this way. Ever since you moved, we’ve barely had time to talk to each other, and I get it, we’re both busy, but this week was supposed to be an exception… For my birthday.”
        </p>
        <br>
        <p>
            “Well, I’m sorry, but things came up.” He sounds like he doesn’t care. Like it’s not really his problem, or he doesn’t want to bother finding a solution. I feel myself getting annoyed.
        </p>
        <br>
        <p>
            “So you don’t want to see me?”
        </p>
        <br>
        <p>
            “That’s not what I said.”
        </p>
        <br>
        <p>
            “Well you can’t tell me right as I land that you suddenly have no money.” I repeat, “When we’ve been planning this for a month.”
        </p>
        <br>
        <p>
            “Look, I’ll find a way,” he suddenly shouts, but his tone is rushed. He sounds frustrated, but more over the fact that we’re still talking as opposed to the actual situation. Like he wants to get rid of me. “My friend owes me. I’ll be there later tonight, I promise.”
        </p>
        <br>
        <p>
            Part of me doesn’t want to take the bait because I feel like he’s half-assing it, but when the driver pulls up to our hotel, I know I’ll have to end the conversation anyway. I groan and force myself to take his word. “Don’t be long.” Assuming he’s taking the next available plane, the flight should only be an hour and a half long. I softly add, “I miss you.”
        </p>
        <br>
        <p>
            “I won’t,” he tells me. “I miss you, too.”
        </p>
        <br>
        <p> 
            I end the call and get out of the car, meeting Amy at the trunk. She sighs as she takes her suitcase from the driver. “I don’t know why you bothered with long-distance with him,” she says.
        </p>
        <br>
        <p>
            I was skeptical about it at first, too, because he was moving to LA for dance, which meant he was going to be very social, and also that he was going to get a lot of attention from pretty Cali girls. But he had told me he wanted me, and that he still wanted to try, so again, I took his word, and we did.
        </p>
        <br>
        <br>
    <p>
Friday — 9:06pm
</p>
<br>
<p>
“How are you pretty ladies doing tonight?”
</p>
<br>
<p>
Amy and I are at a Blackjack table in the casino of our hotel. The rest of the room is crowded with people at slot machines, the Poker tables, craps, but our section is pretty empty. I prefer one-on-one anyway; Amy doesn’t play. She sits next to me like a trophy wife, and she knows—well, hopes—this will keep me occupied from my thoughts.
</p>
<br>
<p>
The dealer is a younger man, maybe a couple years older than us. He’s got blond hair combed back and a piercing on his left ear. He wears a burgundy vest over white sleeves and a black bow tie around his neck. Amy’s been eying him since we got to the table.
</p>
<br>
<p>
“I’m doing fine.” She gives him a saucy wink, her rosy lips pulled into a side smirk as she shimmies in her chair with her strawberry daiquiri in hand. She glances at his name tag. “How about yourself, <em>Paul</em>?”
</p>
<br>
<p>
“I’m okay.” He grins at her, then looks to me. “How ‘bout you, darling?”
</p>
<br>
<p>    
I don’t mean to ignore him, but one of the cocktail waitresses comes by and I wave her over. I order another Long Island to get tipsy off of so that I can enjoy the game more and refrain from checking the phone in between my legs. I haven’t had any notifications, and I’m antsy.
</p>
<br>
<p>    
“She’s fine, too,” Amy answers for me, putting her hand on my arm and bringing my attention back to the table.
</p>
<br>
<p>
“Sorry,” I say to him when the waitress leaves. I place another bet on the table, and he passes out the cards. It’s only been two rounds, but both times I’ve bumped with him.
</p>
<br>
<p>    
He leans back when he finishes, then gestures to my hand. “What’s it gonna be?”
</p>
<br>
<p>    
There’s a 9 of clubs and a 2 of hearts before me. “Double down,” I immediately say, placing another set of chips beside my original bet. He slides another card my way, but when he flips it over, it’s another 2. I curse under my breath. He presses his lips together.
</p>
<br>
<p>
When he turns to his hand, there’s an 8 of clubs and a 6 of diamonds. He flips his next card, which happens to be a 7 of spades, like it’s nothing. “Twenty-one,” he says. I watch as he takes away both stacks of chips in front of me.
</p>
<br>
<p>    
“Holy shit,” Amy says as I sink back in my seat defeatedly. She’s hunched over the table, biting the tip of her straw. “She should’ve won that.”
</p>
<br>
<p>    
“Yeah, that’s a common one—”
</p>
<br>
<p>    
“No, seriously,” Amy tells him. “My girl usually has <em>the best</em> of luck playing Blackjack. All the casinos in Illinois, we robbed clean.”
</p>
<br>
<p>    
“Yeah?” Paul clears his side and puts the cards in a discard pile. “How’s that?”
</p>
<br>
<p>    
“I used to gamble with my grandma.” I reluctantly slide another bet onto the table. “Amy likes to joke that it’s in my blood, and obviously there’s no proof to that because it’s all by chance, but I usually have a good hand when I’m playing with cards.” I take a breath. “I don’t know, though. Maybe it’s just a really bad day. My luck’s been slim all three rounds.”
</p>
<br>
<p>
“Maybe it’s the dealer.” Amy takes the strawberry off the rim of her cup and brings the tip to her mouth, sucking lightly. “Come on, Paulie, let us win a couple rounds.”
</p>
<br>
<p>
He gives a short chuckle and looks down as he deals the next set of cards. “I’ll try.”
</p>
<br>
<p>
<em>Try</em>. That stupid word that I’m starting to feel means nothing.
</p>
<br>
<p>
I’ve got a 10 and a 6 this time, and I really don’t want to hit but I do anyway because I know there’s a low card coming up somewhere in that deck, and I’d rather have it than him. A 3 comes out, and I quietly cheer in my head, waving to stay and thinking he can’t possibly beat 18 until he flips his own cards, and I see that the numbers perfectly add up to 19.
</p>
<br>
<p>
“House wins,” Paul murmurs, scooping my chips away slowly. I can see that he genuinely feels bad for me, but I scoff and throw myself back in my seat again.
</p>
<br>
<p>
“This game is stupid.” Subconsciously, I grab my phone from my lap and turn it on, even more annoyed now that there’s no update from Erik. I automatically call him and bring the phone to my ear. Out of the corner of my eye, I can see Amy giving me a weary look, but I ignore her.
</p>
<br>
<p>
“I’m sorry, hon,” Paul says quietly to me. “I’m gonna have to ask you to put that away. Rules say you can’t have them at the table.”
</p>
<br>
<p>
The call drops at the second dial tone, and I’m hit with the voicemail message. My stomach knots, and I feel like I’ve been slapped on the face. I’m pissed off now.
</p>
<br>
<p>
“That’s okay, I think I’m done playing for tonight.” I get off the highchair and stuff my phone in my purse. “You took all my money, afterall,” I tease, but my voice is dry, and I hope he doesn’t take it the wrong way because I really was trying to have a good time. Amy throws her arm around my shoulders, and I take my Long Island off the table and turn toward the exit. It’s my first night in Vegas, but I already know money probably isn’t going to be the only thing I’m losing.
</p>
<br>
<br>
<p>
Saturday — 10:57am
</p>
<br>
<p>
Welcome to fabulous Las Vegas; in the morning, Amy makes me put on a sash and a tiara because I’m the birthday girl, and “the birthday girl <em>always</em> needs a sash and a tiara.” I lay on the bed and wait for her to finish getting ready, which takes a while because she has to shower.
</p>
<br>
<p>
When she comes out of the bathroom, she’s in her little red dress with her hair all pinned back and her face glowing, and she asks me, “How do I look?” I feel bad because I don’t answer her at first, and she catches me with my phone in my hands. Originally I was posting a picture of my outfit, but after leafing through endless birthday message and getting bored, I end up asking Erik where he’s at—multiple times, I’ll admit, but as expected, there’s no answer—and so of course, now I’m too mad to give her a real compliment.
</p>
<br>
<p>    
“You look great, as always,” I start, but her face has already fallen flat and she is no longer glowing. She grabs my hand and pulls me off the bed.
</p>
<br>
<p>    
“Come on,” she demands. “Let’s go out.”
</p>
<br>
<p>    
She spends the entire day trying to get my mind off of him again. She knows I like to impulse-buy when I’m upset, but for once, I’m not excited about Gucci, Louis, or Chanel. She gets us a reservation for lunch at the Eiffel Tower because she knows I love everything Paris, but when I’m not fascinated by the refinery or the view of the Bellagio water show below us, she knows she’s got to try harder.
</p>
<br>
<p>
So when we’re done eating, she purposely makes me walk on the inside of the sidewalk. It’s closer to the shops, to the bars, to the shirtless men asking for pictures. She wants them to see me, wish me happy birthday. She wants them to give me a free drink, invites to their club; she wants me to <em>interact</em>, something I’m usually good at doing if I wasn’t still checking my phone. 
</p>
<br>
<p>    
Four minutes ago.
</p>
<br>
<p>    
Instagram, the app he’s most active on, says he was online four minutes ago to like a picture of another girl’s butt—not even the photo I posted. I’m mad, but then I realize it’s not her that bothers me; it’s the amount of times he’s liked her photos and has commented on them with fire emojis and hearts and googly eyes, dating back to almost three weeks.
He was online four minutes ago, but he hasn’t spoken to me, answered me—hasn’t taken a flight, or taken a car and driven four hours from Los Angeles to here like he told me he would. Four minutes ago, and someone else is already more important than his girlfriend. And when I come home at four in the morning from a bar with Amy and still see no message, I’m even more mad. I’m drunk and I’m livid, and when I check his social media one more time for the night and see he’s in a club in Santa Monica with that same girl briefly, barely, slightly in the background, I hate everything about him.
</p>
<br>
<p>    
<em>You know, if you didn’t want to come, you could’ve just told me</em>, I type harshly onto the phone, and throw it across the room.
He didn’t even tell me happy birthday.
